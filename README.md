<h1 align="center"> Website DDA </h1>

This is the repository of the DDA Website project initiated by IPDS 59. Our goal is to break bad habits in the application development process in government by trying to work on this project professionally following agile development best practices. Hopefully, through this project, we can learn to get used to developing IT projects in government professionally so that the IT applications produced can be well maintained and follow existing best practices so that they can be used in the long term.
